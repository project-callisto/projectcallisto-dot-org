        <h3>Our Supporters</h3>
        <p>Callisto has an incredible community of donors and volunteers who make our work possible. Our funders include The Skoll Foundation, Google.org, The New York State Health Foundation, The New York Women's Foundation, The Levi Strauss Foundation, NoVo Foundation, The Horace W. Goldsmith Foundation, PIMCO Foundation, Fast Forward, The Harnisch Foundation, and many others.</p>
        <p>We are also supported by over 600 individual donors — many of whom are survivors or allies who share our vision of a world where survivors are supported and sexual violence is rare. Callisto is indebted to the survivors who have offered their time, energy, and feedback as we developed our tool. Their insights have made the reporting system stronger and continue to inspire us to go forward.</p>
