        <div class="sgParagraph">Rape, sexual assault, and sexual coercion can have lasting effects on your mental health. That is because these are serious violations of your body and trust—and not because you are not strong. As a survivor, you might develop symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, or insomnia after an incident. You might struggle with feelings of shame, guilt, or inadequacy. None of these responses to trauma make you a weak person, and there are many resources to help you feel better.</div>

        <div class="sgParTitle">Psychotherapy</div>
        <div class="sgParagraph">Psychotherapists help us navigate through difficult times of our lives, find new meaning in trauma, and teach us helpful coping skills. Psychotherapists usually hold degrees in counseling, social work, or psychology. It is helpful to search for a trauma-informed therapist, as they specialize in treating survivors.</div>
        <div class="sgParagraph">Finding a psychotherapist can seem like a big undertaking, but it doesn’t have to be. <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists"target="_blank"><span class="highlightText">Psychology Today</span></a> and <a href="https://www.goodtherapy.org/"target="_blank"><span class="highlightText">GoodTherapy.org</span></a>, for example, have therapist search engines that allow you to search by specialty, insurance, or by the kind of treatment they offer. Once you have found a couple of therapists that accept your insurance, offer a sliding-scale fee, and have a history of working with trauma patients, give them a call to set up an initial consultation. This will allow you to figure out whether you and the psychotherapist will work well together. It's okay if it takes a while to find a therapist that is the right fit for you.</div>
        <div class="sgParTitle">A Note About Treatments</div>
        <div class="sgParagraph">Some psychotherapeutic <a href="https://www.ptsd.va.gov/understand_tx/tx_basics.asp" target="_blank" class="highlightText">treatments</a>, including EMDR (eye movement desensitization and reprocessing), PE (prolonged exposure), and CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy), have been found to be highly effective on trauma survivors. When looking for a therapist, ask them if they offer these treatments. Do not be discouraged if they don’t—they might still be able to help you.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="sgcfLeft sfgcHalf">
        <div class="sgParTitle">Psychiatry</div>
        <div class="sgParagraph">Psychiatrists are trained medical doctors, and have the ability to prescribe medication. Your therapist might refer you to a psychiatrist if they believe that psychiatric medication would help you feel better.</div>
        <div class="sgParTitle">Online or Text-Based Therapy</div>
        <div class="sgParagraph">If in-person therapy is not for you, you can speak to someone online from the comfort of your own home.</div>

        <div class="sgParagraph">You own your story. Only you can decide if it is the right time in your journey to talk about your experience with loved ones. If you choose not to talk about it, that is okay too. There is never pressure to come forward if you do not feel ready.</div>

          <div class="prepTitle">Preparation</div>
          <div class="prepParagraph">If you are feeling nervous, you might want to consider writing down what you want to say beforehand. That way, if you lose your train of thought, get emotional, or have a difficult time finishing, you can rely on your notes. It can also help to tell your loved ones what your expectations are of them, so they can prepare themselves. For example, you might want to open with, “I would like to share something that happened to me with you. It won’t be easy for me to talk about, and it might not be easy for you to hear. I only ask that you listen, and be patient with me.”</div>
          <div class="prepParagraph">After the conversation, try to find time to practice self-care.</div>

      </div>
      <div class="sgcfLeft sfgcHalf">
        <div class="basicTitle">Time & Location</div>
        <div class="sgParagraph">If you have decided to tell the people you love what happened to you, the timing and location of the conversation can be important. For example, it can help to have the conversation when none of the parties involved are in a hurry—so avoid morning rush hours, or when you or your loved one have an immediate commitment. It can also help to have the conversation in a quiet place you find safe.</div>
        <div class="sgParagraph">Sometimes, even when we say and do all the right things, these conversations might not go well. Our loved ones might be afraid, angry, or triggered themselves, and act in ways that make you feel unsupported. To prepare for these difficult moments, you might want to consider picking a place you can leave comfortably if you need to remove yourself from the conversation. That way, if the conversation does not go the way you hoped, you can say, “thank you so much for listening. I’m going to need some time for myself now.”</div>
