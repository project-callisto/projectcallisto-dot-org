          <div class="sgParagraph">We know that this time in your life can be very stressful and that much of the language here may be triggering or upsetting. However, we also hope that you find this guide to be empowering and uplifting. It is written by fellow survivors to remind you that you are surrounded by a community of caring individuals, and that there are many resources available to help you on your journey.</div>
