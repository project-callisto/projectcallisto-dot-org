<p>In November 2011, Callisto CEO Jess Ladd founded Sexual Health Innovations (SHI) while she was a graduate student at Johns Hopkins University. SHI was founded with the goal of creating technology to advance sexual health and wellbeing in the United States.</p>

<p>In 2014, SHI announced an initiative called Callisto at The White House Data Jam on Campus Sexual Assault.</p>
	    
<p>A year-long pilot of Callisto launched in August 2015 at the University of San Francisco and Pomona College. Callisto’s successful pilot, growing demand for the system both within and outside of the college setting, and a growing national dialogue on campus sexual violence led SHI to decide in the summer of 2016 to reorganize and rebrand as Callisto. Today, Callisto is available at a growing number of colleges nationwide.</p>

            <p class="pre-bullet"><strong>About Callisto:</strong></p>
            <p>Callisto is a rapidly growing nonprofit tech startup that has created an online sexual assault reporting and documentation system that helps identify serial sexual predators. The system launched 2.5 years ago on 2 pilot college campuses, and has since grown to 12 colleges and an entertainment industry pilot. Reporting on participating campuses has doubled, assaults have been reported 60% faster, and 15% of victims have matched with another victim of the same assailant (meaning they were informed that they weren't the only one and connected to the same investigator or legal advisor). In the next year, we will be rapidly expanding to address sexual assault and coercion in multiple industries, connecting victims of the same predator together and with legal support.</p>
