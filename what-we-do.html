      <h3>Our Products</h3>
      <p>In 2015, Callisto launched “Callisto Campus” to support college sexual assault survivors. It is currently available on <a href="https://www.callistocampus.org/" target="_blank">12 campuses across the United States</a>. Survivors who visit their school's Callisto Campus site are 6x more likely to report their assault.</p>
      <p>In 2020, Callisto will be launching a new product and offering, enabling us to serve more survivors and detect serial perpetrators across many institutions.</p>

        <h3>The New Callisto</h3>
        <h4>Supporting Survivors through our new Callisto experience</h4>
        <p>This year, Callisto will launch an online platform designed to meet the needs of college students who have experienced sexual assault. It will allow survivors of repeat offenders to connect with pro bono attorneys, learn more about their options moving forward, and choose the path best for them. Repeat offenders can be detected across campuses and regardless of their campus affiliation, allowing survivors who may have been assaulted off campus, or while visiting another state or university, to still access services.</p>
        <p>Callisto serves the unique needs of student survivors. Through our system, a survivor can create an entry and hold their perpetrator’s identity in escrow until another victim of the same perpetrator comes forward. Any serial perpetrator can be detected, regardless of their university affiliation. When a match occurs (meaning two survivors independently identify the same perpetrator), both survivors are put in touch with their own pro bono legal advocate, or Legal Options Counselor (LOC). The LOC consults the survivor on how to best achieve their desired outcome. Common paths forward include reporting to Title IX or the police, confronting their perpetrator directly, pursuing legal recourse, engaging in restorative justice, or publicly sharing their experience. Should both survivors of the same perpetrator wish, Legal Options Counselors can connect them together to collaboratively decide on next steps.</p>

          <!-- <p>Callisto recognizes that predators who repeatedly commit sexual assault and/or coercion are not limited to any institution or industry. Coverage of widespread sexual misconduct through the #MeToo movement has highlighted the pervasiveness of this issue.</p>

  	<p>In 2018, we expanded our reporting platform to detect repeat perpetrators across different sectors. Callisto for professional industries adapts our unique matching model, providing unique support options to victims:</p>

          <h3>Callisto Campus</h3>
          <div class="paragraph-extra-spacer">
              <p>An estimated 20% of women, 7% of men, and 24% of trans and gender nonconforming students are sexually assaulted during their college career. An estimated 90% of sexual assaults are committed by repeat perpetrators. Over 85% of college survivors know their assailant, and less than 10% report to their school or the police.</p>
              <p>Callisto Campus allows college sexual assault survivors to learn about their school's and police department's reporting channels, connect with local resources, create a record of their assault, or learn whether there are other victims of the same perpetrator. Callisto Campus is available on <a href="https://www.callistocampus.org/" target="_blank">12 college campuses</a>.</p>
              <p>Survivors who visit their school’s Callisto Campus website are six times more likely to report their assault and three times more likely to connect with medical or emotional resources. And 15% of survivors entering our matching system (see below) match with another victim of the same assailant, causing them to report simultaneously.</p>
