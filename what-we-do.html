      <h3>Our Products</h3>
      <p>In 2015, Callisto launched “Callisto Campus” to support college sexual assault survivors. It is currently available on <a href="https://www.callistocampus.org/" target="_blank">12 campuses across the United States</a>. Survivors who visit their school's Callisto Campus site are 6x more likely to report their assault.</p>
      <p>In 2020, Callisto will be launching a new product and offering, enabling us to serve more survivors and detect serial perpetrators across many institutions.</p>

        <h3>The New Callisto</h3>
        <p>In 2020, Callisto will launch a new product. Similar to Callisto Campus, the new product will detect serial sexual offenders. But in this new system, victims of serial offenders will be connected to an attorney rather than the Title IX Office of their school.</p>
        <p>This attorney will help survivors understand a wide range of options for taking action to protect their community (e.g. report to police, report to HR, report to the Title IX Coordinator, go public). They will also help victims of the same perpetrator share information with one another and coordinate their actions.</p>


        <p>How Callisto Expansion works:</p>
        <p>If more than one victim of the same perpetrator—after speaking with their Legal Options Counselor—wants to connect with other victims of the same perpetrator, their Legal Options Counselors will facilitate the sharing of information. This will enable survivors to gather information that might change what action they individually want to take, or to coordinate to take the same action together at the same time.</p>

          <!-- <p>Callisto recognizes that predators who repeatedly commit sexual assault and/or coercion are not limited to any institution or industry. Coverage of widespread sexual misconduct through the #MeToo movement has highlighted the pervasiveness of this issue.</p>

  	<p>In 2018, we expanded our reporting platform to detect repeat perpetrators across different sectors. Callisto for professional industries adapts our unique matching model, providing unique support options to victims:</p>

              <p>Victims input the identity of their perpetrators under the precondition that, if a match is found, a Callisto Legal Options Counselor reaches out to each victim individually.</p>

              <h5>LEGAL OPTIONS COUNSELING</h5>
              <p>A Callisto Legal Options Counselor will guide victims through the reporting process, their choices, and offer to connect them with others who have named the same assailant.</p>

          <h3>Callisto Campus</h3>
          <div class="paragraph-extra-spacer">
              <p>An estimated 20% of women, 7% of men, and 24% of trans and gender nonconforming students are sexually assaulted during their college career. An estimated 90% of sexual assaults are committed by repeat perpetrators. Over 85% of college survivors know their assailant, and less than 10% report to their school or the police.</p>
              <p>Callisto Campus allows college sexual assault survivors to learn about their school's and police department's reporting channels, connect with local resources, create a record of their assault, or learn whether there are other victims of the same perpetrator. Callisto Campus is available on <a href="https://www.callistocampus.org/" target="_blank">12 college campuses</a>.</p>
              <p>Survivors who visit their school’s Callisto Campus website are six times more likely to report their assault and three times more likely to connect with medical or emotional resources. And 15% of survivors entering our matching system (see below) match with another victim of the same assailant, causing them to report simultaneously.</p>
