      <h3>Our Approach</h3>
      <p class="content">Callisto is a non-profit organization that creates technology to combat sexual assault and harassment. Our technology is designed to empower survivors with options to seek support and identify repeat perpetrators. Callisto Campus is our flagship online system, which enables student survivors to document and report sexual assault and help identify repeat perpetrators. Callisto is considering an expansion to address both sexual assault and harassment in professional institutions and industries, contingent on philanthropic support.</p>

      <h3>Callisto Campus</h3>
      <div class="content">
        <p>An estimated 20% of women, 7% of men, and 24% of trans and gender nonconforming students are sexually assaulted during their college career. An estimated 90% of sexual assaults are committed by repeat perpetrators. Over 85% of college survivors know their assailant, and less than 10% report to their school or the police.</p>

        <p>On college campuses, our trauma-informed platform increased the chances that a survivor will report, the speed of reporting, and the detection of serial sexual assailants. Survivors who visited their school’s Callisto Campus website were 5 times more likely to report their assault than survivors who did not. The time it took for survivors to report using Callisto Campus (4 months) was almost three times faster than the national average of 11 months.
           And 15% of survivors entering our matching system (see below) matched with another victim of the same assailant, causing them to report simultaneously.</p>
      <article>
        <b>Student survivors are offered three options:</b>
        <div class="value-prop-item">
          <img src="../images/Assets/record-icon.svg" alt="Write">
          <div>
            <b>WRITE</b>
            <p>Survivors can create secure, encrypted, and time-stamped records about their sexual assault. Without Callisto, student survivors who report begin the process 11 months after experiencing sexual assault. Callisto allows survivors to immediately preserve evidence on their own terms, at a time, place, and pace that is best for them. No one can see the details of a record without explicit consent of the survivor - they are encrypted in a way that not even the Callisto team can view.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="value-prop-item">
          <img src="../images/Assets/match-icon.svg" alt="Match">
          <div>
            <b>MATCH</b>
            <p>Survivors can help their institution identify repeat offenders using Callisto Campus’ matching function. This option allows survivors to store information about their perpetrator under the precondition that it will only be released to the institution if another student names the same perpetrator. If matched, the institution receives the verified contact information of both victims and the name and unique identifiers (e.g. facebook URL) of the perpetrator. Survivors are informed that there has been a match and that their institution will reach out to them, and are asked if they want to report their stored record to aid in the investigation.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="value-prop-item">
          <img src="../images/Assets/report-icon.svg" alt="Report">
          <div>
            <b>Report</b>
            <p>Survivors can electronically send the record they have created to their institution to trigger an investigation or a consultation. Callisto Campus equips institutions with a detailed account of what happened before the student ever meets with them, enabling a higher-quality and lower-trauma investigation. </p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </article>
      <p>Reports submitted through Callisto led to more rapid and thorough investigations and reduced the chances for human error. According to surveys, survivors most often reported in order to protect their community. By empowering survivors with pathways to desired outcomes, Callisto helps to stop perpetrators sooner and creates a deterrent for other would-be perpetrators.</p>
      <p>Universities that partner with Callisto receive a school-specific Callisto website (including custom content on reporting options and resources), along with training and materials to roll it out to their students. Callisto also provides aggregate data reports to inform the policies and practices of our partners.</p>

      <h3>Callisto Expansion</h3>
      <p class="content">Callisto recognizes that predators who repeatedly commit sexual assault or harassment are not limited to any institution or industry. In 2017, coverage of widespread sexual misconduct began to spur more and more survivors to come forward. Callisto has begun exploring expansion to detect repeat sexual perpetrators across professional institutions and industries. We need your support to make this possible.</p>
