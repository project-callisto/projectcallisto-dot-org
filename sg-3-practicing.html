        <div class="sgParagraph">Sometimes the pressure to engage in self-care after a traumatic experience can create even more stress. You may wonder if you are doing it correctly or you may feel a need to demonstrate your strength and resilience to others.</div>
        <div class="sgParagraph">We hope that this list will inspire you to engage in self-care that is the right fit for what you need. Remember that whatever works for you is the “right” way.</div>
        <div class="sgParagraph bottomText">Research shows that 70% of sexual assault survivors experience moderate to severe distress, which is a larger percentage than for any other violent crime. (NSVRC, 2015)</div>

        <div class="sgParagraph boldItalic">Talking about, or even thinking about, your traumatic experience can be emotionally draining. Because it is difficult to predict how you might feel on any given day, you might want to consider building a regular plan for self-care. Ideas include going for a run, visiting a museum, taking a relaxing bath, or spending time with a close friend. Below are some self-care tips to consider.</div>
        <div class="sgParTitle">Engage in physical movement.</div>
        <div class="sgParagraph">Run. Walk. Bike. Climb. Swim. Take a dance or martial arts class. Enjoy the sensation of your physical body in a positive way through movement.</div>
        <div class="sgParTitle">Care for your mind.</div>
        <div class="sgParagraph">Meditate. Download a mindfulness app or podcast. Attend a spiritual or guided meditation service. Play soothing music while you breathe deep and relax. Engage in active mindfulness through activities such as art, crafting, cooking, or organizing.</div>
        <div class="sgSig">Take care of yourself.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="sgcfLeft sfgcHalf">
        <div class="sgParTitle">Find new positive experiences. </div>
        <div class="sgParagraph">Research shows that people find greater happiness from positive activities and experiences, rather than physical things. Examples include massage, acupuncture, live music, theater, museums, volunteering for a cause you that you find meaningful, day trips with loved ones, and exploring intimacy with a partner.</div>
        <div class="sgParTitle">Take care of the basics.</div>
        <div class="sgParagraph">Establish a sleep routine. Eat to nourish your body. Take time to bathe and groom yourself. Visit healthcare providers.</div>
